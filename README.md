This is my first video game project just a demo really.   I wanted to learn how to make games, so I challenged myself to start from scratch and learn the basics and make a complete game.  Its short, its simple, and it only took 4 days to complete from a person that has never made a game and wanted to learn.  I made this one in Godot 4 and used all public domain assets.
